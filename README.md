# Cosmos Engine

> A visual node-based effects and shader engine for Minecraft modding.

Cosmos is a web-based node editor designed to eliminate the boilerplate of writing GLSL shaders and creating visual effects for Minecraft (Forge/Fabric). By connecting logical nodes, developers can visually design shaders, entity VFX, and projectile trails, and instantly export the necessary `.vsh`, `.fsh`, and JSON metadata for their mods.

## Features (In Development)

- **Visual Node Graph:** Build complex math and color logic without writing raw GLSL.
- **Live 3D Preview:** See your shader compile and render on a 3D canvas in real-time.
- **Mod Export Pipeline:** Export directly to Minecraft-friendly formats ready to be hooked into Forge or Fabric.

## Tech Stack

- **Core:** TypeScript, React, Vite
- **Node Engine:** React Flow
- **3D Context:** Three.js / WebGL
